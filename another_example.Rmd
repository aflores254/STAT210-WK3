**This is an R Notebook.** You can use it to take notes and run code. For example, you can write your name on the line below. _Try it_:  
  
Todayâ€™s date is `r Sys.Date()`.    


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{r}
mean(cars$speed)
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r} 
{echo=FALSE}
# some r coding
hist(rnorm(100, 0, 5)) fig.width=5, fig.height=5
```


The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
